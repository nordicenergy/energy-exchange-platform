## kdgrass  [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/dfcreative/kdgrass.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dfcreative/kdgrass)

[KDBush](https://github.com/mourner/kdbush) with flat API, which turns out to be even faster.

[![npm install kdgrass](https://nodei.co/npm/kdgrass.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/kdgrass/)

```js
const kdgrass = require('kdgrass')

let grass = kdgrass(points);
let ids1 = grass.range(10, 10, 20, 20);  // bbox search - minX, minY, maxX, maxY
let ids2 = grass.within(10, 10, 5);      // radius search - x, y, radius
```

## API

### let grass = kdgrass(points, nodeSize?)

Creates an index from the given points.

- `points`: Input array of points in `[x, y, x, y, ...]` form.
- `nodeSize`: Size of the KD-tree node, `64` by default. Higher means faster indexing but slower search, and vise versa.

```js
let index = kdgrass(points, 64);
```

### grass.range(minX, minY, maxX, maxY)

Finds all items within the given bounding box and returns an array of indices that refer to the items in the original `points` input array.

```js
let results = index.range(10, 10, 20, 20).map((id) => points[id]);
```

### grass.within(x, y, radius)

Finds all items within a given radius from the query point and returns an array of indices.

```js
let results = index.within(10, 10, 5).map((id) => points[id]);
```
